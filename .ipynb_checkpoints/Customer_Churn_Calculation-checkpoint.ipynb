    "# Calculate Customer Churn Metrics\n",
    "Churn results when a customer cancels their subscription or relationship with a company. Preventing customer churn is critical, and some estimates suggest that acquiring a new customer can be as much as [25 times as costly](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers) as keeping an existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to reducing churn is understanding the extent to which our customers are churning. We will cover three churn metrics we can use to know how many users and how much revenue we are losing to churn. It is appropriate for subscription data or other forms of recurring revenue data."
